GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS) is a set of security features designed to help developers identify and mitigate vulnerabilities within their repositories. It includes:
- Code Scanning: Uses CodeQL and other tools to detect security vulnerabilities in source code before deployment.
- Secret Scanning: Identifies sensitive information (API keys, passwords, tokens) that may have been accidentally committed.
- Dependency Review: Analyzes changes in dependencies before merging a pull request, highlighting potential security risks.
- Push Protection: Prevents developers from committing secrets by blocking them before they reach the repository.
